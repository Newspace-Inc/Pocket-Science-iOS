<key>The female grasshopper lays eggs in a hole in the sand. She produces a liquid which hardens to form a case around the eggs, thud preventing predators from eating them.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>It takes about 2 weeks for the eggs to develop into nymphs.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The nymph's resemble adults but are smaller in size and have no wings</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Each nymph moults ( shedding its old skin and growing s new one ) about 5 times as it grows into an adult.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Life cycle of a Cockroach</key> <dict><key>The cockroach has 3 stages in its life cycle.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The female cockroach lays 16 to 40 eggs in a hard, brown egg case in dark and warm places.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>It takes about 6 to 7 weeks for the eggs to develop into nymphs.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The nymph's resemble adults but are smaller in size and have no wings</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Each nymph moults ( shedding its old skin and growing s new one ) several times as it grows in size, changing to a darker shade if brown and growing wings.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Life cycle of a Mosquito</key> <dict><key>The mosquito has 4 stages in its life cycle.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The female mosquito lays eggs on the surface of still or stagnant water.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>It takes about 14 to 16 days for the mosquito to develop from egg to adult.  Eggs hatch into larvae in 2 to 3 days.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>A larva is also known as a wriggler. Wrigglers look very different from adults.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>They feed on tiny food particles and microscopic organisms in water. They breathe through a breathing tube. They moult several times and grow rapidly. After 8 to 10 days, the larva becomes a pupa.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>A pupa is comma-shaped and does not feed or move. It hangs itself just under the water surface by its breathing tube. Adult structures develop and in 1 to 2 days, an adult emerges from the pupa.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Mosquitoes can spread diseases like malaria, dengue fever and yellow fever. Being small and having the ability to fly makes it difficult to destroy them. Hence, the easiest way to kill them is to destroy their breeding grounds while they are still in the larva and pupa stages.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Life cycle of a Frog</key> <dict><key>The frog has 3 stages in its life cycle.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The female frog lays eggs in water and a male frog fertilize them.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Eggs are laid in masses and are covered with a smelly jelly-like substance that repels predators, thus preventing the eggs from being eaten up.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>It takes about 2 weeks for eggs to develop into tadpoles, which do not resemble their parents. They breathe through gills at this stage, feeding on tiny plants and algae. The hind legs grow first, followed by the front legs about 4 weeks later. Lungs then slowly develop replace the gills.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The young frog's tail shortens and it now resembles the adult. goes to the water surface to breathe, using its lungs. As an adult, the lungs become fully developed and its tail and gills have completely 'disappeared'.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The adult also uses its moist skin to breathe when in water.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Depending on the species, it can take a few months to a year for the frogs develop from tadpoles to adults.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The life cycle of a toad is similar to a frog's but the toad's eggs are laid in a string.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Life cycle of a Butterfly</key> <dict><key>The butterfly has 4 stages in its life cycle.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>It takes about 40 days to develop from an egg an adult</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The female butterfly lays eggs in batches of 10 to 100 on the underside of the leaves where its young can get food easily and where there is less chance of being detected by predators. The embryo inside the egg gets nutrients from the yolk. The larva that hatches from the egg feeds on its egg shell and the leaf on which it is hatched.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The cocoon splits and the adult butterfly emerges. It takes about 2 hours for its moist and soft, crumpled wings to dry, harden and spread out before it flying.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Life cycle of a Mealworm</key> <dict><key>The mealworm beetle has 4 stages in its life cycle.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>It takes about 100 days for the egg to develop into an adult.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The female mealworm beetle lays tiny white eggs (on land). The eggs hatch into cream-coloured larvae in 7 days. The larva is also known as the mealworm, which grows rapidly and moults up to 15 times. Each larva is about 3 mm long and has a small head and a pair of short feelers. It feeds on cereals, grains or breads.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>After about 3 months, it becomes a pupa. At the pupa stage, it does not feed or move. Adult structures develop and in 7 to 8 days, the adult mealworm beetle emerges out of the case.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Life cycle of a Housefly</key> <dict><key>It takes about 11 days to develop for the egg to develop into an adult.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Fertilised eggs are laid on food, faeces, rotting flesh and other warm organic material.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The young of houseflies are known as maggots. Maggots have no wings and cannot fly. Maggots have no compound eyes and they feed on the material their eggs were laid on (usually rotting meat). Pupation six days (depending on species) and during this process the young develops wings and compound eyes.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The adult housefly develops fully and emerges from its cocoon.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Life cycles of Flowering Plants and Ferns</key> <dict><key>The life cycle of a plant shows the different stages of development or growth of a seed or other plant parts into an adult plant.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Most flowering plants reproduce from seeds.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Seeds of flowering plants are usually found inside the fruits. Each seed contains a baby plant that is protected by seed leaves. The seed leaves provide food for the germinating seed until it is able to make its own food when its green leaves sprout.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>When a seed starts to grow, it germinates. Seeds require air, warmth and water to germinate.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>When the seed germinates, its roots will appear first. Roots absorb water and nutrients from the soil for the baby plant. Once the roots have started growing, the shoot will appear and leaves will start to sprout.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The seedling (young plant) is able to make its own food when its first leaves appear. At this stage and onwards, the plant needs sunlight to grow.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>As it matures, the young plant grows into an adult plant. Adult flowering plants bear flowers.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Flowers, when fertilised, develop into fruits. These fruits contain seeds that can grow into new plants, thus starting a new cycle.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Ferns grow from spores. Each spore is able to grow into a fern.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Cycles in matter and water (Matter)</key> <dict><key>The 3 states of matter and examples</key> <dict><key>Matter can exist in 3 states.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>The 3 states of matter and examples - Solid state</key> <dict><key>Matter in the solid state are known as solids. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Examples are a cup, pencil, lorry, chair, book, brick, sand, copper, leaf, wood, ice and dry ice (frozen carbon dioxide)</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>The 3 states of matter and examples - Liquid state</key> <dict><key>Matter in the liquid state are known as liquids.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Examples are water, milk, petroleum, coffee, oil, orange juice, kerosene, and mercury (liquid metal)</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>The 3 states of matter and examples - Gaseous state</key> <dict><key>Matter in the gaseous state are known as gases. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Examples are water vapour, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, helium (used to fill balloons that float in the air) and neon.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>The characteristics of Solids, Liquids and Gases</key> <dict><key>The characteristics of Solids, Liquids and Gases</key> <dict></dict>
<key>All 3 states of matter (solids, liquids and gases) have mass and occupy space.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>The characteristics of Solids (Part 1)</key> <dict><key>A solid has a definite (or fixed) shape and a definite volume. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>A solid cannot be compressed.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>The characteristics of Solids (Part 2)</key> <dict><key>Has definite shape</key> <dict></dict>
<key>A solid does not change its shape by itself. E.g. a car, a pencil, a bowl, rock, table, etc. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>The shape of solids are only changed with the application of external force. E.g. a piece of rock that has been sculpted into a statue, a sheet of paper that has been folded into a crane</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>The characteristics of Solids (Part 3)</key> <dict><key>Has definite volume / Cannot be compressed</key> <dict></dict>
<key>A solid's volume or the amount of space it occupies will always remain the same. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>This means that the volume of a solid cannot be changed or compressed to occupy a smaller space.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>If a box (the space) can hold exactly 6 wooden blocks (solids), we cannot squeeze or change the volume of the blocks to pack more blocks into the box.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>The characteristics of Liquids (Part 1)</key> <dict><key>A liquid has a definite volume but NO definite shape.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Having a definite volume means that a liquid cannot be compressed.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>The characteristics of Liquids (Part 2)</key> <dict><key>No definite shape</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Liquid takes the shape of its container. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>It has no fixed shape</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>The characteristics of Liquids (Part 3)</key> <dict><key>Has definite volume</key> <dict></dict>
<key> A liquid's volume or the amount of space occupies is fixed.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>This means that the volume remains the same regardless of the shape of containers it is in.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Just like a solid, a liquid cannot be compressed. It cannot be made to occupy a smaller space or volume.</key> <dict></dict>
<key> If we try in pour in some more water into a glass is that is already completely filled with water, the water will overflow from the glass.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>The characteristics of Gases (Part 1)</key> <dict><key>A gas has no definite shape and no definite volume. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>A gas can be compressed</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>The characteristics of Gases (Part 2)</key> <dict><key>Has no definite shape</key> <dict></dict>
<key>A gas takes the shape of its container. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>It has no fixed shape.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>As you blow air into a balloon, the air inflates the balloon and will occupy a space that is controlled by the shape of the balloon. A similar example is pumping air into a soccer ball.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>The characteristics of Gases (Part 3)</key> <dict><key>Has no definite volume </key> <dict></dict>
<key>The volume of a gas is not always the same (i.e. not constant). </key> <dict></dict>
<key>It occupies completely the space in which it is kept. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>The volume of a gas can be changed. It can be either compressed to occupy a smaller space or spread out to occupy a bigger space. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Under normal atmospheric conditions, a certain amount of air will occupy a fixed volume of space. However, this volume of air can be increased by applying pressure or reduced by decreasing pressure.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Differences among Solids, Liquids and Gases (Part 1)</key> <dict><key>Has Definite shape?</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Solid has a definite shape but both liquid and gas do not have a definite shape</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>Differences among Solids, Liquids and Gases (Part 2)</key> <dict><key>Has Definite volume?</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Gas can be compressed but both solid and liquid cannot be compressed.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>Differences among Solids, Liquids and Gases (Part 3)</key> <dict><key>Can be compressed?</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Both solid and liquid have a definite volume but gas does not have a definite volume</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>Differences among Solids, Liquids and Gases (Part 4)</key> <dict><key>Types of solid</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Soft solids change their shapes more easily compared to hard solids. For instance, a table cloth forms the shape of the table top but not the other way around. These are due to external forces acting on the cloth which includes gravity and friction.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Solids can appear to flow like liquids and gases as well as take up the shapes of containers if each single part is very small, like sand, sugar and flour. In an hourglass, extremely fine grains of sand flow easily from the top to the bottom compartment. The shape each grain of sand actually remains the same but this is not observable as the grains are too tiny.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>Differences among Solids, Liquids and Gases (Part 5)</key> <dict><key>Solids and liquids that are less dense* than water will float and those that are denser than water will sink.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Solids that float on water: cork, ice, most types of wood</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Solids that sink in water: rock, ice, ceramic, glass, brick, most metals</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Liquids that float on water: oil, petrol, turpentine</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Liquids that sink in water: mercury, honey</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Density is not about how heavy an object is. For instance, heavy (tree) logs are transported by river as they can float while a very light paper clip will sink in water. This is because when a log is cut down to the size of a paper clip (if it is possible), the amount of matter in that space is less than that contained in the paper clip. This means that the log is less dense than the paper clip.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>Differences among Solids, Liquids and Gases (Part 6)</key> <dict><key>The different viscosities (the degree of thickness and 'stickiness') of liquids affect their movement or ease of flow. Paint, glue and latex (liquids with high viscosity) flow slower while water and turpentine (liquids with low viscosity) flow faster.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>When poured, honey flows out of a cup more slowly than water because it has a higher viscosity. The water will also \"break apart\" and splash about more as water is less sticky.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Each part in a system has its own function(s). Different parts work together to enable the system to carry out its specific function.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Every living thing is a system made up of many parts.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>Why are plants important to living things</key> <dict><key>Plants are important to living things as they provide us with food, replenish the air with the oxygen that they produce during photosynthesis, provide shelter, provide protection for some animals, beautify our surroundings, can be used as materials for making furniture and have roots that hold the soil together, thus helping to reduce soil erosion.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Human System</key> <dict><key>The sensory system - The 5 sense organs, what they sense and their functions</key> <dict><key>The human sensory system is made up of 5 main sense organs that gather information from the surroundings. This system detects and responds to changes around us.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The information gathered is transmitted or sent to our brain through a network of nerves. The brain assesses this information, decides what to do and then sends instructions to the rest of the body on the appropriate action to take.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>The human digestive system (Part 1)</key> <dict><key>When we are hungry, we eat. The food we eat gives us energy to carry out lme processes.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The digestive system helps us to break down food into simpler substances that our body can absorb.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Digested food is absorbed by the blood and is use to produce energy while not digested food moves through the system and is removed from the body.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The human digestive system is made up of 5 main parts, the mouth, gullet, stomach, small intestine and the large intestine.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Waste is stored at the end of the large intestine (rectum) and then released through the anus.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>The human digestive system (Part 2)</key> <dict><key>The process of digestion starts in the mouth.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Digestion of food takes place only at 3 places - the mouth, stomach and small intestine</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Path taken by food: Mouth -> Gullet -> Stomach -> Small intestine -> Large intestine -> anus and rectum</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>The human digestive system - Mouth</key> <dict><key>Digestion of food starts in the mouth</key> <dict></dict>
<key>When we chew. our teeth grinds food down into smaller pieces.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The incisors (the flat, sharp teeth at the front of the mouth) cut and slice the food into smaller pieces.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The molars (the broad, round teeth at the back of the mouth) mash and crush the food into even smaller pieces.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The tongue mixes the food with saliva. Besides wetting and lubricating the food so that it can go down the gullet more smoothly, saliva also contains a digestive juice that starts breaking down some of the food. The tongue shapes the food into a small ball, which is then swallowed.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>The human digestive system - Gullet</key> <dict><key>Food swallowed in the mouth goes down a tube called the gullet of oesophagus.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The muscles in the walls of the gullet push the food down to the stomach</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>The human digestive system - Stomach</key> <dict><key>Here, more digestive juices are added and muscles around the stomach move and churn the food. After two to five hours, the solid food is partially digested into a porridge-like form,</key> <dict></dict>
<key>This partly digested food then leaves the stomach and enters the small intestine.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>The human digestive system - Small Intestine </key> <dict><key>The small intestine secretes more digestive juices to digest as much of the remaining food as possible.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Digested food is absorbed into the bloodstream through tiny blood vessels around the walls of the small intestine,</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The blood in the blood vessels transports the digested food to other parts of the body to be converted into energy for life processes</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The small intestine is very long and has many folds (creases) to increase its surface area and increase the absorption rate of digested food</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>The human digestive system - Large Intestine </key> <dict><key>The remaining food that is undigested enters a wider tube called the large intestine. This is shorter but wider than the small intestine.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Water and some minerals are absorbed from the undigested food into the bloodstream,</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The remaining undigested food becomes partially solid and is temporarily stored in the lower part of the large intestine called the rectum.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The partially solid waste is finally passed out from the body through the anus as faeces.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>\"Freely suspend\" means that magnet is allowed to move and rotate freely until it rests in a particular direction. The magnet can be balanced and hang on a thin and soft string are placed on a non-magnetic floating object in water.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The bar magnets will come to rest in a North-South direction after a few minutes</key> <dict></dict>
<key>A compass can be used to tell directions because the compass needle acts as a freely suspended magnet. It will always rest in the North-South direction unless it is close to another magnet or magnetic material.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>How to store magnets</key> <dict><key>To ensure that permanent magnets retain your magnetism for a longer time, they should be stored properly</key> <dict><key>For a horseshoe magnet, a single flat piece of soft iron called the keeper is placed across both poles of the magnet</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The keeper is usually made from soft iron or steel</key> <dict></dict>

<key>How to make temporary magnets</key> <dict><key>An ordinary object can be made into a magnet if it is or contains a magnetic material.</key> <dict><key>There are 3 ways of making a temporary magnet, namely by stroking, electrical and induction.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Stroking method when a magnetic material is stroked with a magnet enough times, it becomes a temporary magnet. The more times it is stroked, the stronger the temporary magnet.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Electrical method - when an electrical current is passed through a wire coiled around a magnetic material, the magnetic material becomes a temporary magnet. It is call an electromagnet. The greater the source of electrical power, the stronger the magnet becomes. Increasing the number of coils will also increase the strength of the magnet.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Induction method - a magnetic object can also be turned into a temporary magnet when it is near or in contact with a magnet. Its magnetic strength will vary according to the strength of the magnet.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The magnetism that is created in objects using the methods described above is not permanent.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>For the induction method, the iron nail will not be able to attract any magnetic substances once the strong magnet is removed. For the electrical method, the electromagnet loses its magnetism the moment the current is switched off.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>2 types of artificial (man-made) magnets can be made:</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Temporary magnets lose their magnetism easily and is usually made of mild steel or iron. Electromagnets are commonly used in products where its property of being magnetized when there is supply electricity can be put to good use, for example electric bells and motors</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Permanent magnets retain magnetism for longer periods of time and is usually made of hard steel or alloys of steel, nickel or cobalt. Permanent magnets are used in compasses, as magnetic strip in credit and ATM cards, in speakers and microphones.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Strength of magnets and 3 ways of demagnetising a magnet.</key> <dict><key>Magnets have different strengths.</key> <dict><key>One way to compare the strength of magnets is to observe the number of identical magnetic objects they are able to attract (and hold on to).</key> <dict></dict>
<key>A magnet's strength depends on the material that it is made from.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Magnets made of mixtures or alloys of cobalt, nickel and iron are stronger than those made of purely iron or steel,</key> <dict></dict>
<key>A magnet can be made to lose its magnetism. The weakened magnet is said to be demagnetised.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>A magnet can lose its magnetism by hitting/dropping it, by heating or by using a demagnetiser.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Characteristics of Living things (Part 1)</key> <dict><key>Living things grow</key> <dict></dict>
<key>They can grow in height or length. They also increase in size.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Their young are generally much smaller than their parents. As they grow, they become bigger and stronger.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Their young are generally much smaller than their parents. As they grow, they become bigger and stronger. Example, seedling grows into a plant and a chick grows into a hen</key> <dict></dict>
<key>As living things grow, other changes take place too. Example, the young of a toad (a tadpole) does not resemble its parents. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Living things grow over time. Some living things, such as a baby and a coconut tree, take many years to be fully grown. Others, such as a chick and a bean sprout take a shorter time to be fully grown. </key> <dict></dict>

<key>Characteristics of Living things (Part 3)</key> <dict><key>Living things move by themselves.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Animals move about in different ways. Example, a butterfly flies, a dolphin swims and a kangaroo hops</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Not all animals move about freely on their own. Example, the sea anemone and coral spend a large part of their lives anchored in one spot. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Animals can also move certain parts of their bodies. Example, a baby waving her hand and a dog wagging its tail</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Animals move about to get food, water and shelter. They also move to run away from danger. Sometimes, they move in search of mating partners. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Plants can also move. However, they stay rooted to where they are and can only move certain parts of themselves. Their movements are usually very slow and less obvious as compared to animals. Example, the branches of a potted plant placed in a dark room will grow towards the window where sunlight is. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Fungi, like plants, stay in one location and do not move as freely as animals. They only move certain parts of themselves.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Under a microscope, you can see that bacteria also move. Some bacteria move slowly while others move quickly. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Characteristics of Living things (Part 7)</key> <dict><key>Living things die. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Their deaths may be due to the following: Lack of air, water or food, accident, old age, disease, pollution or eaten up by other living things</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Different living things have different lifespans. Human beings, on average, can live up to 80 years while certain species of trees or plants can live up to a few hundred years. </key> <dict></dict>

<key>Characteristics of Living things (Part 9)</key> <dict><key>Living things reproduce.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Since living things cannot live forever, they reproduce to ensure the survival of their species. This will prevent them from becoming extinct. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Some animals reproduce by laying eggs. Example, chicken and turtle</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Some animals reproduce by giving birth to their young alive. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Example, a pig and its piglet or a jaguar and its cub</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Most flowering plants reproduce from seeds. The parent plants produce seeds. When the surrounding conditions are suitable, the seed will grow into a seedling which will then develop into an adult plant that will eventually bear flowers and fruits. Example, life cycle of a plant</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Some plants reproduce by vegetative propagation, a process that involves the growing of new plants from different parts of the parent such as roots, stems and leaves. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Non-flowering plants reproduce by spores. Spores are very thin in size but like seeds, each spore can develop into a new plant. Example, moss and fern</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Fungi also reproduce by spores.  </key> <dict></dict>

<key>Materials</key> <dict><key>Introduction to materials. </key> <dict><key>Materials can be natural and man-made. Natural materials can come from animals, plants or the ground. Man-made materials are artificially made using chemicals. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>A material can be a finished product or an unprocessed raw material. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Raw materials are first extracted or harvested from the earth and then processed to produce semi-finished materials, which then can further undergo a new cycle of production and finishing processes to create finished materials ready for distribution, construction and consumption. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>An example of a raw material is cotton, which is harvested from plants. Cotton can be processed into thread which can be woven into cloth, a semi-finished material. Cutting and sewing fabric turns it into a garment, which is a finished product. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>One type of material can be used to make different kinds of objects. For example, metals can be used to make spoons, keys and forks. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>A combination of materials can be used to make an object. Some examples are wood for the table and its legs and rubber for the base of the legs. </key> <dict></dict>

<key>Animals: Classification of Animals</key> <dict><key>Difference in Size, Colour and Shape</key> <dict><key>Animals are different in size. For example, Killer whale and polar bear are large in size while beetle and mosquito are small in size.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Animals are different in colour. For example, peacock and butterfly are more colourful looking while the crow and spider are more dull-looking.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Animals are different in shape. Some animals have similar body shapes but are different in size, such as a crocodile and a lizard. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>Difference in Habitat</key> <dict><key>Animals need homes for protection against bad weather such as the wind, cold, rain and sun and reproduction</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Habitats provide shelter for animals. Food and water are usually within easy reach. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>As different animals have different needs, their habitats are found in different places. There are two kinds of habitats, in water and on land. In water habitats consists of seas, rivers, lakes and ponds. On land habitats consists of trees, grasslands, caves and underground. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>The following are examples of animals that live on land. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>For example, squirrels and monkeys live on trees, zebras and giraffes live on grasslands, bats and bears live in caves, and earthworms and rabbit live in underground burrows.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>There are also many animals that live in water. For example, sharks and whales live in the sea, ducks and geese live in lakes, crocodiles and crayfish live in rivers, and water stick insects and pond skaters live in the pond.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>There are some animals that live both on land and in water. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Example, frogs</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Animals may be taken away from their natural habitats and placed in man-made homes. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Example, Zoos, aquariums, farms and our homes</key> <dict></dict>
<key>There are four kinds of food and animal products from farm animals which are food, milk, egg and others.  </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Food consists of chicken, pig, cow, duck, prawn and fish.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Milk consists of cow and goat.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Egg consists of chicken, duck and quail</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Others consists of silkworm for its silk, sheep for its wool and cow for its leather. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Some animals are kept on farms for food and animal products. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Some animals are kept in aquariums and zoos so that we can view and study them. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Example, deer, zebra and penguin</key> <dict></dict>
<key>There are also some animals that are kept in our homes as pets.</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>Difference in Body Movement</key> <dict><key>Animals can move from one place to another.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>They move about to look for food, water and shelter. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>They also move around to look for mating partners.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>They move to escape from their predators and poachers.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>They move about in many different ways. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>The movements of animals differ because each animal has its own unique body structure that suits the living environment. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>There are six different movements.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Hopping. Animals that move about by hopping usually have strong legs. Example, toad and grasshopper</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Flying. Most animals with wings can fly. They fly by flapping their wings. Example, butterfly and eagle</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Crawling. Animals that crawl move about by using their legs and with their bodies very near or touching the ground. Example, tortoise and caterpillar.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Climbing. Animals that move about by climbing have specially designed limbs, sharps claws and strong beaks to help them climb trees. Example, squirrel and koala bear.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Gliding. Animals with no legs move about by gliding. They use their body muscle to glide. Example, snail and snake</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Swimming. Some animals make use of their fins, tails, bodies and legs to swim in the water. Example, seal and angel fish</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Many animals can move about in more than one way. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Man. Walk, run, hop, skip, crawl and swim. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Tiger. Walk, run, jump, skip, climb and swim. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Duck. Walk, fly and swim. </key> <dict></dict>

<key>Different animals have skins which are different in colour, thickness and texture.</key> <dict><key>Animals have skins that are different in colour. Example, some dogs are black and some are white.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Animals have skins that are of different thickness. Example, chickens have soft and thin skins, while cows have thick and tough skins. Example, snakes have smooth dry skins, while crocodiles have rough skins.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Animals have skins that are of different textures. Example, snakes have smooth dry skins, while crocodiles have rough skins.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The body of every animal is covered with a layer of skin.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Some animals make use of the special patterns and colours  on their skin to blend in with their surrounding environment. This is called camouflage. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>There are some animals that have outer coverings on their skins. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>Outer coverings are important to animals. </key> <dict><key>Outer coverings keep them warm, help them fly, protect them, beautify them and camouflage them.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>There are four different types of outer coverings.</key> <dict><key>The four are hair, feathers, scales and shells. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Mammals have a layer of hair on their skin. This layer of ahir includes wool, bristles and fur. The amount, length and texture of this hair vary according to the natural conditions of the mammals' habitats. The hair keeps the body warm by trapping air in it to prevent its body heat from being lost to the surroundings. Example, polar bears and sheep have a thick coat of hair, while pigs and elephants have a thin layer of hair. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Birds have a layer of feather on their skins. Young birds have small and fluffy feathers called down feathers to keep them warm. Older birds have flight feathers which besides keeping them warm, also enable them to fly. The feathers also protect the birds from getting wet on rainy days and in water. Example, goose and swan. Some male birds have bright, colourful feathers to attract their female counterparts. Example, peacocks and roosters have colourful feathers to attract their mating partners.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Fish and reptiles have scales on their bodies. Scales are hard and tough. They protect the animals and help to prevent the body fluids of reptiles from dying. Example, cod fish, garoupa, snake, lizard and crocodile.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Some animals have shells to protect them from harsh environments and their predators. Example, crab, lobster, prawn, tortoise, snail and clam.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>There are some animals that do not have any outer coverings on their skins. Example, squid, octopus, frog and earthworm.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Some of these animals have skins that help them breathe. Others have shell-like skins to protect them from harm. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>Different animals have different eating habits. They are classified into three groups.</key> <dict><key>The three eating habits are herbivores, carnivores and omnivores.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Herbivores are animals that eat plants only. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Different herbivores eat different parts of a plant. Example, horses, hippopotamuses and snails eat leaves and grasses. Bats, parrots and squirrels eat fruits, seeds and nuts of plants. Bees, butterflies and hummingbirds eat pollen grains or drink the nectar of flowers. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Carnivores are animals that eat other animals only. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>The characteristics of carnivores are sharp and strong teeth or beak and claws, moves quickly, strong eyesight, strong build and highly sensitive sense of smell.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Examples of carnivores include leopards, wolves, tigers, lions, crocodiles, great white sharks and eagles.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Some carnivores eat only insects. They are known as insectivores.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Examples of insectivores are lizards, bats and frogs. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Omnivores are animals that eat both plants and other animals. Example, ostriches eat seeds, grains, insects, lizards etc. Raccoons eat nuts, fruits, insects, frogs, etc.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Animals cannot make their own food. They depend on other living things for food. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>Why do Animals reproduce?</key> <dict><key>When animals have young, we say they reproduce.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Animals reproduce to avoid becoming extinct and to ensure the survival of their own kind.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>Animals have two modes of reproduction.</key> <dict><key>Laying eggs on land and in water or giving birth to young alive one at a time or a few at a time.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Animals that reproduce by laying eggs have their young hatched from eggs. Some animals lay their eggs on land. These eggs have hard shells to protect them. Example, turtle and beetle. Some animals use their body warmth to incubate their eggs. Example, turkey, swan and penguin. Other animals lay their eggs in soil and sand and allow the warmth of the sun to incubate them. Example, crocodile, iguana and turtle. Some animals lay their eggs in water. These eggs usually do not have shells. Example, frog, fish and salamander. Eggs laid in water are usually large in numbers as many of  them may be eaten up by other animals.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Some animals give birth to their young one at a time. Example, zebra and whale. Others give birth to their young a few at a time. Example, lion and rabbit. Mammals usually give birth to their young alive. However, the platypus and the spiny anteater are exceptions; they lay eggs.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>Characteristics of their young</key> <dict><key>The young of animals usually resemble their parents and differ only in size. Example, elephant, goat, giraffe, dolphin and crocodile. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>The young of some egg-laying animals do not look like their parents.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>However, as these young grow and develop, they undergo changes and will eventually look like their parents. The process of the change is called metamorphosis. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Many animals take care of their young. They feed their young, protect them from danger and predators and teach them skills needed for survival. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>Some animals do not take care of their young.</key> <dict><key>Example, turtle, frog and butterfly.                                                           </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Example, both the male and the female eagles take care of their eaglets. As soon as the first egg is laid, the female and the male take turns to incubate. During the first four weeks after hatching, one of the parents (usually the female) broods the babies to keep them warm almost all the time, especially when the weather is cool. When the weather is hot and sunny, one or both of the parents shade the babies. The parents bring food to the nest 1 to 8 times per day to feed the babies. When a baby eagle fledges (loses its fluffy down feathers and grows flying feathers), a parent will hover over the nest and flap its wings and patiently teach it to fly.</key> <dict></dict>

</dict>
<key>Characteristics of Animals</key> <dict><key>Animals around us differ from one another in body shapes and sizes, their living habitats, and the way they move. However, some of them do share similar characteristics.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>These similarities enable us to classify them into groups. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Vertebrates are animals with backbone and invertebrates are animals without backbones. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Animals can also be grouped as cold-blooded or warm-blooded animals. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Body temperature in cold blooded animals changes according to the surroundings. Example, insect, fish, reptile and amphibian. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Body temperature in warm blooded animals does not vary much, whether or not the temperature of the surroundings changes. Example, bird and mammal.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>Characteristics of fish. </key> <dict><key>Fish are cold-blooded vertebrates.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Most fish either live in saltwater (marine) or freshwater. Example, Seahorse, angel, guppy and shark</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
<key>There are many types of fish but there are certain characteristics that classify them as a group. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>The common features are eye, mouth, gill cover, dorsal fin, scale, tail, pectoral fin, anal fin and pelvic fin.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Most fish have fins to help them swim, balance and steer their bodies in water. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>The tail or caudal fin is used to propel the fish through water.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The pectoral fin is used for steering the body of the fish.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The pelvic fin helps the fish to maintain a balance. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>In some fish, the dorsal fin extends and joins the tail fin.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The body shapes of fish are quite varied. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>This is because fish have developed their bodies to suit their habitats for survival reasons.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>For example, fast-moving fish like the sharks have streamlined bodies to help them swim more easily while stingrays have flat bodies to help them look for food along the seabed. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>The bodies of most fish are covered with scales which overlap in one direction. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>The scales serve to protect the fish and to minimise friction when the fish are swimming in the water. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Some fish like the mudfish and catfish have no scales. Instead, they are protected by a tough leathery skin. Also, most fish are covered with a layer of mucus. It makes them slimy and are, therefore, difficult to grasp. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Fish have eyes but no eyelids. This is why they appear to be awake all the time. However, they do have periods of rest when their metabolic rate slows down. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>However, they do have periods of rest when their metabolic rate slows down.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Most fish breathe in the water using gills. Gills are found under the gill cover. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Gills are found under the gill cover. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Water enters the fish through its mouth and as the fish closes its mouth, the water is forced to pass over the gills. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>As water flows between the gills, dissolved oxygen in the water is taken in through the gills. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>At the same time, carbon dioxide given out by the fish dissolves in the water which then flows out of the gills under the gill cover.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Some fish like the mudskipper can survive out of the water for a few hours because they can retain water in their mouths and can breathe in air through their skin. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Most fish reproduce by laying eggs</key> <dict></dict>
<key>However, some fish, like guppies, sharks and swordtails give birth to their young alive.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Most fish do not take care of their young.</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>Characteristics of birds</key> <dict><key>Birds are warm-blooded vertebrates.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Like other animal groups, they also have distinct characteristics.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Opaque materials do not allow light to pass through.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>They have feathers to keep them warm, protect their bodies and help them fly. Some birds have colourful feathers that help them attract their mating partners. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Some birds have colourful feathers that help them attract their mating partners.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>All birds have wings, but only those with strong muscles and special lightweight skeletons are able to fly.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Examples of birds that are flightless include the ostrich, kiwi and penguin.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Different birds have different kinds of feet. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Their feet are adapted to suit their habitats for various reasons.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Birds have no teeth but have beaks.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Their beaks are adapted for their feeding habits. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>The third kind is a probing beak. An example is the hummingbird.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The fourth kind is a flesh-eating beak. An example is the eagle.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The fifth kind is a straining beak. An example is the goose.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The sixth kind is a spearing beak. An example is the kingfisher.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>All birds reproduce by laying eggs.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Their eggs have hard shells. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>They usually lay their eggs in a nest and use their body warmth to incubate the eggs. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Birds take care of their young until they grow up and become independent.</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>Characteristics of Mammals</key> <dict><key>Mammals are warm-blooded vertebrates. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Some mammals live on land while some live in water. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Mammals breathe through their lungs. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>As such, mammals that live in water have to come up to the surface of the water for air.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Mammals have an outer covering of hair on their bodies to keep them warm. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>The amount of hair on each mammals varies. It depends on the living environment of the mammals. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>For example, polar bears have very thick hair while pigs have very little hair.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Female mammals feed their young with milk. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>This milk is produced by the mammary glands.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>All mammals have two pairs of limbs. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>However, for some mammals, their front limbs have been adapted for other users.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>There are three main types of mammals. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Placentals are mammals who have their babies developed inside the females. The body receives nourishment from its mother until it is ready to live outside the mother's body. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Marsupials are pouched mammals. The female gives birth to its young when it is still undeveloped and keeps it inside its pouch. The newborn then continues to develop until it is ready to live on its own. Example, kangaroo and koala. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Egg laying mammals reproduce by laying eggs. Example, spiny anteater and platypus. </key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>Characteristics of insects</key> <dict><key>Insects are cold-blooded invertebrates. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
<key>All insects have a body that is divided into three parts: the head, the thorax and the abdomen. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Each part is further divided into segments, but only the segments on the abdomen can be seen clearly.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>All insects have three pairs of jointed legs. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Each pair of legs is attached to one segment on the thorax.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Each insect has a pair of jointed feelers called antennae on its head. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>The antennae give the insect a sense of smell and touch.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>An insect's body is protected by an outer covering of a layer of hard skin called the cuticle or the exoskeleton. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>It gives the insect its shape and protects its soft body.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Most insects have two pairs of wings. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>The wings are attached to the second and third segments of the thorax. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Examples of such insects are the dragonfly and butterfly.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>However, some insects such as the mosquito use only one pair of wings to fly. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>The second pair of wings is used for balancing themselves.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>For some insects, such as the ladybird, the first pair of wings is thick. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>They form hard protective shields for the insects. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>There are also some insects which do not have wings and therefore cannot fly. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Examples include the silverfish and the ant.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Insects reproduce by laying eggs and their young hatch from these eggs. Most of the time, the young will go through some changes before they eventually look like their parents. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Most of the time, the young will go through some changes before they eventually look like their parents.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Some insects, like the cockroach and the grasshopper, have young that resemble the adult. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>They are only smaller in size and have no wings.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>There are some invertebrates such as the spider, millipede and woodlouse that are not considered insects.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>They have segmented bodies, but have more than six jointed legs.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Properties of light</key> <dict><key>There are four important properties of light to take note. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Light travels in a straight line. This explains why we cannot see things round the bend of corners. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Light can be reflected. This explains why we can see objects which are not sources of light around us. The light falls on these objects reflects light into our eyes. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Light can be absorbed. This explains how shadows are formed. When light cannot pass through opaque objects like wood or metal (when the objects block the path of light), a shadow of the object will be formed. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Light can be transmitted. If light goes through an object, it is said to be transmitted. This explains why we can see through glass, air and water clearly. </key> <dict></dict>

<key>What happens when light strikes an object?</key> <dict><key>When light rays travel and strike a surface, they may be reflected, transmitted or absorbed. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>When light is reflected, most of the objects around us are not sources of light. They are called non-luminous objects. These objects only reflect light, which means when light falls on these objects, it bounces off them. The light that bounces off these objects travels to our eyes and enables us to see them. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>This explains why we cannot see anything, not even our fingers, in a pitch-dark room. As there is no light source in the dark room, no light will fall on the objects in the room. Hence, no light will be reflected from them and we are not able to see anything. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>All objects reflect light. Animals, plants, fungi and non-living things reflect light. The amount and direction of the reflected light depend on the type of surface it strikes. Smooth and shiny surfaces reflect light better than rough and dull ones. For example, steel spoons and aluminium foil can reflect light much better than dark-coloured towels and charcoal. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>The reflection of light from a smooth surface is called a regular reflection. When light falls on the smooth surface, it bounces off at matching angles which results in a reflection.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>However, when a surface is rough or unpolished, the light rays that fall on it are reflected or scattered in all directions. We call this a diffused reflection. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>When light is transmitted or absorbed, besides reflection, light rays that fall on objects can also be transmitted or absorbed. We say that these objects are transparent, translucent or opaque. </key> <dict><key>Some objects allow light to pass through like glass. These objects are transparent. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Some objects like frosted glass transmits part of the light that falls on it, so we cannot see them clearly. These objects are translucent. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>These objects like wood does not allow light to go through. If it is not reflected on the object, some light is absorbed. The amount of light an object absorbs depends on the object's surface. Rough and black surfaces are better light absorbers than white and shiny surfaces. These objects are opaque. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Thus, when light strikes an object, it will react in one or more of the ways mentioned above, depending on whether the object is transparent, translucent, opaque, smooth, rough or glossy.  </key> <dict></dict>

<key>Light and Shadows (Part 1)</key> <dict><key>Opaque objects do not allow light to go through them. When light falls on an opaque object, it cannot bend and go around the object since light travels in a straight line. Thus the object, which blocks the path of light, casts a shadow.

<key>Heat</key> <dict><key>Introduction to heat</key> <dict><key>Anything that gives off heat is a source of heat. Most sources of light are also sources of heat</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Some examples of sources of heat are listed below</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Heat from the Sun</key> <dict></dict>
<key>If we have been out on a hot day, we would have felt the heat from the Sun</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The Sun is our main source of heat and light.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The Sun's energy is known as solar energy and plants make use of this solar energy for photosynthesis</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Man makes use of the Sun's heat to dry wet clothes and to preserve food.</key> <dict></dict>
<key> Solar heaters make use of the Sun's heat to make the water hot.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Heat from fuels</key> <dict></dict>
<key>A fuel is anything which burns to produce energy. \u2022 Examples of fuels are kerosene, wood and gas.</key> <dict></dict>
<key> Fuels burn to give off heat and light. Heat from electricity </key> <dict></dict>
<key> A metal wire gets very hot when electricity passes through it.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>he electrical energy has been changed to heat energy.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Some metals release more heat than others when electricity passes through them. For example, iron releases more heat than copper. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>In order for electricity to be used as a source of heat, we must first produce electricity. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Man has learned to use electricity to produce heat in many household appliances for different purposes. Examples include the water heater and the iron. </key> <dict></dict>

<key>Introduction to heat (Part 1)</key> <dict><key>Heat from friction </key> <dict></dict>
<key>When we rub our hands together for 30 seconds and then place our palms on our cheeks, the heat that we feel is the result of friction.</key> <dict></dict>
<key> Heat is produced when two objects are rubbed together and the objects become warm in this process of rubbing due to friction.</key> <dict></dict>
<key> Cavemen started fires by rubbing two sticks or stones together and when they do that, kinetic (movement) energy is converted to heat energy.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Often, lubricants, such as oil, are used to decrease friction and the amount of heat created in machines.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Heat from chemical reaction</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Chemical reactions occur every day all around us. A chemical reaction is a process where one type of substance is chemically converted another substance.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Chemical reactions can produce heat in a number of ways.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>For example, oxygen in the air reacts with the charcoal in a barbecue grill and produces heat and light.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Sugar when heated breaks down into carbon and water vapour and produces heat in the process.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The rusting of iron and the digestion of food are also chemical reactions that give off heat. For example, chemical reactions that occur in digestion give off heat that keeps our bodies warm and functioning</key> <dict></dict>

<key>All about temperature</key> <dict><key>We experience temperature every day. When it is very hot outside or when we have a fever, we feel hot and when it is raining and windy outside, we feel cold. We feel hot or cold depending on the environment around us and our recent experiences.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Knowing the temperature of things can be very important. Cooks may need to know when the turkey is fully cooked, or parents might have to make sure that a child is not running a fever. In laboratory testing, precise measurements of temperatures are required frequently in experiments.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Temperature is not energy, but a measure of it. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Temperature is a measure of the degree of hotness or coldness of matter. Usually we feel an object with our hands to find out how hot or how cold the object is. However, this is not a good method to measure temperature. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>The human sense of touch is not an accurate measure of the degree of hotness and coldness, and it is sometimes dangerous to rely on this method. An extremely cold object may cause frostbite while an extremely hot object may scald us.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Temperature does not depend on the size or type of object. For example, the temperature of a small cup of boiling water is the same as the temperature of a large pot of boiling water even if the large pot is much bigger than the cup.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Uses of Good and Bad conductors of Heat (Part 11)</key> <dict><key>Many materials are poor conductors of heat because they contain tin pockets of air. Woollen clothing and accessories are worn by people living in temperate countries to keep warm. These woollen materials trap a layer of air in them. The air is then warmed by the body to maintain the body's temperature. Since both the woollen and air are poor conductors of heat, they will help to slow down heat loss from our bodies to the cold surroundings and thus, keep us warm</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Expansion and contraction of matter (Part 1)</key> <dict><key>Most matter expands when they are heated (or when they gain heat) and contracts when they are cooled (or when they lose heat). Thus when a piece of metal is heated, it expands and upon cooling, the metal contracts and tries to resume its original shape</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Expansion and contraction of matter (Part 2)</key> <dict><key>Household thermometers also work according to this principle: The mercury a liquid metal in the thermometer held in a hand, rises due to the expansion of the mercury from the heat of the body.

<key>Expansion and contraction of matter (Part 3)</key> <dict><key>Not all materials contract or expand at the same rate. The amount of contraction or expansion varies depending on the material, Some things expand a lot when heated while others expand slightly. A very good example is the bimetallic strip. A bimetallic strip is made of brass on one side and steel on the other. When heated, the bimetallic strip bends because one metal expands more than the other. In this case, the strip curves toward the steel side as shown in the diagram below. When cooled in liquid nitrogen, it curves the other way.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Cycles</key> <dict><key>Reproduction in Plants</key> <dict><key>Flowers</key> <dict><key>Generally, a a flower acts as a medium to enable the male and female reproductive cells to fuse in order to produce seeds. The process begins with pollination followed by fertilisation and continues with the formation and dispersal of the seeds</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Some flowers grow in clusters while others grow singly. All flowers, however, have a protected ovary to contain the seeds and stamens to produce pollen.Flowers often hove showy petals and produce sweet nectar to attract insects. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>After the flower opens, the sepals can often be seen behind the petals. The sepals protect and sometimes support the corolla (which refers to a group of petals). The petals send signals to insects that there is nectar in the flower.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Nectar is secreted at the base of the petals on the inside of the flower. The nectar is used to lure insects to the flower and the insects get a dusting of pollen as they crawl into the flower to reach for the nectar. Then the insects fly off to other flowers, taking the pollen from the first flower with them. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Insects carry the pollen from flower to flower to pollinate the flowers which eventually results in fertilisation of the reproductive cells between male and female flowers</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>Reproductive parts of a flower</key> <dict><key>The flower holds the reproductive parts-stamen (male reproductive part) and pistil (female reproductive part). The stamen produces pollen grains (male reproductive cells). The pistil is in the centre of the flower. The unfertilised seeds (also known as ovules) are located at the bottom of the pistil.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The pistil makes up the female reproductive part of a flower Seeds are produced here. A flower may have one or more pistils.The parts of a pistil include the: </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Stigma - a small, sticky pad where the pollen grains stick to a tube where the pollen grains grow down towards the ovary. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Style - a tube where the pollen grains grow down towards the ovary. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Ovary - contains the embryo seeds (or ovules) which grow into seeds once fertilised.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Generally the will of the ovary protects the developing seeds. When the seeds are mature, they are often found in some sort of encasement. The encasement could be o pod, a fruit or a berry. These seeds are usually scattered far away from the parent plant by the various forms of seed dispersal.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Stamen The stamen is the male reproductive organ of a flower It is made up of two parts </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Filament - a slender stem that supports the anther  </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Anther - contains pollen a where pollen grains are formed, it splits to release the pollen during pollination</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The anthers open when the pollen is mature, releasing a fine, powdery dust. Some types of pollen are only ripe for few days while some lost much longer. We often think of pollen as yellow powder, but it can be white, orange, brown, purple or black, and it comes in many different shapes and sizes. These pollen grains are easily picked up by an insect or a bird. A flower may receive pollen from many different kinds of plants. However, only pollen grains from the same kind of plant will begin to grow.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>Pollination</key> <dict><key> Pollination is the transfer of pollen from anther of a flower to the stigma of the some flower or of another flower. There one few flowers that con self pollinate. Pollination has to happen before fertilisation con take place.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Many plants are pollinated by animals. Plants may attract pollinators by having colourful flowers, fragrances and sugary nectar. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>As the pollinators climb around flower searching for and drinking the nectar, their bodies are covered with pollen As a pollinator moves from one flower to the next, pollen falls from the pollinators body as it moves, thus pollination the flowers. Bees, ladybirds, moths, butterflies, birds, bots, giraffes and beetles are some animals that pollinate plants. We con also pollinate plants as we brush against flowers ond inadvertently collect and transfer pollen</key> <dict></dict>
<key>In some plants, pollen falls from the anther to the stigma on the some flower, thus eliminating the need for a pollinator. This process is called self-pollination. Self-pollination is beneficial for plants that are isolated from their own kind. Self-pollination is usually undesirable, because it reduces the chances of getting new combinations of genes</key> <dict></dict>
<key>In wind pollination, pollen is distributed by wind among the flowers. These species of plants do not develop scented flowers nor do they produce nectar. Male and female reproductive organs are generally found in separate flowers, the mole flowers having a number of long filaments terminating in exposed stamens, and the female flowers having long, feather-like stigma. Pollen from wind pollinated flowers tends to be smaller and lighter than pollen from insect pollinated flowers. These pollen have very low nutritional value to insects</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>Fertilisation</key> <dict><key>Fertilisation is the fusion of sperm and egg. This takes place in the ovule. For fertilisation to take place, pollen of the right type must join up with the ovules. The pollen that falls on the stigma germinates and the pollen tube grows out and grows through the style toward the ovule.The ovules are  contain the DNA of the female parent plant, but cannot develop into complete seeds until they have had the DNA of the male parent plant  added. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Fruits and seeds result from sexual reproduction in flowering plants. The is an ovary that has developed and matured A fruit usually contains seeds.Fruits are adaptations for dispersing seeds while seeds function in the dispersal and propagation of plants. Some fruits are fleshy with parts that are edible Some fruits are dry while others are heavy and are designed to be dispersed by falling and rolling away from the parent plant. Some have wings or fluffy tak to enable them to be carried away by the wind to be dispersed.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The DNA is contained in chromosomes and when the ovules or stamens on being made, the DNA of the plant divides in half, and each parent puts o set its own chromosomes into its half of the reproductive element (the the female parent and the pollen for the male parent) ovules do When the ovules are fertilised, the two sets of chromosomes join together to make the double set which a new plant needs The fact that the same genes are passed on to each succeeding generation what makes the new plant similar to its parents; for example, daisies produce daisies in the next generation and do not have the DNA to produce After fertilization, the ovule becomes a seed and the ovary becomes a fruit.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>There are basically two types of fruits Fleshy fruits and Dry fruits</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Seeds develop from the ovules in the female plant, after they have been fertilised by the pollen from the male parent plant Seeds are not visible unless the more mature and ripe. Unripe seeds are soft, White or green, and enclosed in a hord green fleshy fruit (pod). When seeds are ripe and mature, they change colour</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The structure of a seed consists of: </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Cotyledons - Food storage organs that function as first seed leaves</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Plumile - Embryo shoot</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Epicotyl - Stem above cotyledon</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Hypocotyl - Stem below attachment point</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Radicle - Stem tip developing into a root</key> <dict></dict>
<key>A seed protects and nourishes the embryo in it Seeds may differ in appearance bond Structures. However, all seeds contain a plant embryo and store food in a protective coot. Although it takes more energy for a plant to produce seeds than spores, seeds have on advantage over spores in their ability to remain dormant.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>Seed dispersal</key> <dict><key>Seed dispersal is the scattering of offspring away from each other and from the parent plant.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>There are two main advantages of seed dispersal, which are, Improved chances of success by reducing competition and overcrowding and enables colonisation of new suitable habitats increased chance of species survival.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Fruits which are dispersed by water have fruits and seeds which ore usually fibrous and con foot on water. For example, buoyant fruits, eg sedge and coconut and buoyant seeds, e.g. water lily pong pong, nipah and lotus.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Seed dispersed by animal are sticky or have little hooks on them. These burrs stick to the fur of passing animals and are carried away to grow in new place, eg burdock, love grass and mimosa</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Seed dispersal by splitting or explosive mechanism There are two types of splitting action for fruits which are dispersed in this manner. For example explosive oration, eg baham and rubber and fruits which split open but without an explosive action eg. African tulip and kapok.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Seed dispersal by wind Fruits which are dispersed by wind have characteristics like wing-like structure, eg. angsana, shorea, dandelion and sycamore, lightweight seeds which enable them to be transported by the wind, e.g orchid and grass, fine hairs to enable them to float in air, e.g lalang</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Fleshy and juicy fruits which act as a food source The fruits are fragrant, sweet and attractively coloured. The seeds pass through the animal digestive tracts or are carried together with the fruit to a new location. Eg, tomato, rambutan, guava, durian, apple and mango. Other plants produce nuts - seeds with hard tells. These seeds roll and bounce, and are gathered by small animals like squirrels</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>Germination</key> <dict><key>Seeds must be placed in proper environmental conditions-optimal moisture, proper temperature, and ample oxygen for them to germinate. Only when these conditions are met would seed germination time place.</key> <dict></dict>
<key> Deloying of germination often assures the survival of the plant. For example, if the seeds thot mature in autumn were to sprout immediately the young plants could be killed by cold weather. If all of a plant's seeds were to sprout at once and all of the new seeds died before producing seeds, the species could become extinct.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>However, for some species of plants, many of their seeds will not germinate even when exposed to conditions ideal for germination. Such seeds exhibit dormancy. In order to germinate and break dormancy, a seed has to absorb quite a bit of water. In nature, seeds absorb this water from the soil. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Environmental factors such as water, Oxygen, and temperature trigger seed germination. Most seeds are very dry and must absorb water to germinate. Water softens the seed coat and activates enzymes that convert starch in the cotyledon or endosperm Into simple sugars, which provide energy for the embryo to grow.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The first visible sign of seed germination is the emergence of the radicle root) soon after the radicle breaks the seed coat, the shoot begins to grow.The embryonic leaves unfold. synthesise chlorophyll and begin to carry out photosynthesis. After their stored nutrients are used up, the shrunken cotyledons fall off</key> <dict></dict>
<key>As the embryo begins to grow, the softened seed coat cracks open, ennobling the oxygen needed for cellular respiration to reach the embryo. Seeds will only germinate if the temperature is within a certain range. Some seeds germinate only after being exposed to extreme conditions, after freezing or passing through a digestive system that breaks down the seed coats</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Reproduction in Animals</key> <dict><key>How living things reproduce</key> <dict><key>There are a few ways in which organisms can reproduce. In uncertain and dangerous environments, organisms will produce many offspring. The more offspring there are, the higher the chances of survival of their species. The life expectancy of these offspring is short as most of these offspring will die before they become adults or before they are ready to reproduce. The parents do not look after their young. The young mature rapidly and reproduce at an early age. They are thus able to reproduce so many offspring as quickly as possible.Animals with many offspring may devote fewer resources to each individual offspring, for these types of animals it is common for a large number of offspring to die soon after birth, but there are sufficient numbers that survive to maintain the population of their species.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>In a stable environment, with a predictable supply of resources and few dangers, organisms produce few offspring. These offspring are cared for by their parents. They are well-developed and tend to live longer. They mature slowly and reproduce at a late age.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>Fertilisation</key> <dict><key>Fertilisation is the union of sex cells (sperm and egg) to form a new organism, a zygote (fertilised ovum), which develops into an embryo.Depending on the species of the animal, fertilisation can occur within the body of the female in internal fertilisation or outside the body of the animal in external fertilisation.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The process of internal fertilisation begins when the male deposits its sperm directly into the female's body. In most mammals and some reptiles, the embryo develops inside the female's body after fertilisation.Most land animals like insects, some reptiles and mammals reproduce by internal fertilisation. However, in birds and most other reptiles, the embryo develops outside the female's body. The female usually lays an egg where the embryo develops within. The egg is protected by a shell that contains material which nourishes the growing embryo and enables it to develop fully.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>During external fertilisation, the male and female reproductive cells unite outside the female's body. This process usually takes place in the water. The male releases its sperms into the water at about the same time that the female release her eggs. Some of the sperms will come into contact with some of the eggs and fertilise them. Most of the aquatic invertebrates and some vertebrates, including the majority of fish and amphibians, reproduce by external fertilisation. The eggs of most fish are fertilised externally.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Reproduction  </key> <dict><key>Reproduction is a fundamental feature of all life. It is a biological process by which new individual organisms are produced. The reproductive process always includes the transfer of hereditary materials from the parent to its offspring so that they too can reproduce. There are two basic types of reproduction--asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Asexual reproduction is the production of new individuals without the union of sex cells sperm and egg). The continuity of life is assured by mitosis. A cell replicates its DNA and becomes twa new daughter cells, each having identical characteristics and carrying on the same life functions as the parent cell.Asexual reproduction is common among simple organisms such as amoeba and single-celled organisms However, it is not limited to single celled organisms. Most plants have the ability to reproduce asexually. Examples of asexual reproduction in plants and single-celled organisms include budding and binary fission respectively</key> <dict></dict>
<key>exual reproduction is the production of offspring through the union of male (sperm) ond female (egg) sex cells. In this process, two individuals are required - a male and a female.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Reproductive parts  </key> <dict><key>Male reproductive system The male reproductive system contains two main parts the penis and the testes. In a male reproductive system, there are two egg-shaped testes The testes produce the sperm The testes lie between the testes between the thighs in a pair of pouch-like bogs called Scrotum or scrotal sac forts of the reproductive Parts of the male reproductive system The scrotum or scrotal sacs, which are found outside the body. Therefore, they have a lower temperature than that of the body. This is necessary for the sperms to develop properly. Sperms are only able to develop at temperature that is lower than that of its body temperature.The penis consists of tissues that have numerous spaces which can be filled with blood. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>The female reproductive system consists of the ovary the oviduct, the uterus, the cervix and the vagina.The ovary produces eggs. When the eggs are mature, they are released from the ovaries. The uterus, also known as the womb, is where the foetus develops during pregnancy. The ovaries are connected to the uterus via the oviduct or fallopian tubes, At certain intervals, the ovaries release an ovum, which posses through the fallopian tube into the uterus, where the egg is usually fertilised in the oviduct. The cervix is located at the lower end of the uterus. During birth, it enlarges to allow the foetus to pass through the vagina.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Reproduction in Mammals </key> <dict><key>Life for an offspring begins when the sperm cell reaches the egg cell during the process of fertilisation. Egg cells mature in the ovary and ore then released into the abdominal cavity called the oviduct. It is within the oviduct that fertilisation takes place. Some mammals, such as dogs, cats and rabbits release several eggs at once, resulting in multiple births Others such as horses, cows and elephants.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Gestation, also known as pregnancy in humans is divided into three periods known as trimesters. Each trimester is 3 months long During these periods, the drain of nutrients can be quite taxing on the mother, who is required to ingest significantly higher levels of calories. In addition, certain vitamins and other nutrients are required in greater quantities than normal often requiring higher consumption of food.The length of gestation for humans range between 37 and 42 weeks.The length of gestation varies greatly from species to species. For dog, their gestation period is nine weeks regardless of breed, 5660 weeks in giraffes and 16 days in hamsters</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Birth</key> <dict><key>When gestation is completed, the foetus that is growing in the mother's womb born alive, having moved through the birth canal. The foetus is ready to breathe air without the umbilical cord for the first time and receive food through its digestive system. The umbilical cord connecting the foetus to the placenta will be cut completely, freeing the newborn from the mother. The placenta will then be expelled by the womb, so that the womb can heal and prepare for another pregnancy. In animals, the umbilical cord is bitten off and eaten by the mother to nourish her and to recycle the proteins. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Some mammals such as mice, cats and rabbits are born blind and helpless. Mammals with longer gestation periods, such as horses, elephants and cattle are able to stand, wolk and even run almost immediately after birth.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Heredity</key> <dict><key>Heredity is the genetic transmission of characteristic traits from the parent offspring by means of genes in the chromosomes of the cells. This transmission of characteristics takes place either through sexual or asexual reproduction.</key> <dict></dict>
<key> Genes determine a person's appearance-height hair colour, skin colour and eye colour. Mental abilities and natural talents are also affected by heredity as is the susceptibility to acquire certain diseases. The gene is defined as the unit of inheritance. Chemically speaking, each gene is the blueprint for a specific type of protein in the body. Proteins are important because they perform many functions in the cells and the human body.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Proteins are made of smaller units called amino acids.There are twenty types of amino acids the human body. Different combinations and numbers of these amino acids make different types of proteins. That means one protein may only have four amino acids while another has twenty; two proteins may both have twenty amino acids but are in a different order in each protein. Each amino acid is made up of three nucleotide bases found in DNA, also known as deoxyribonucleic acid. Each DNA molecule consists of two parallel strands twisted around each other to form a double helix. A helix is a coiled structure like a corkscrew or spring. A molecule of DNA is wrapped around proteins to form a single chromatin thread. During cell division, chromatin threads coil tightly into structures called chromosomes inside the cell nucleus.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Chromosomes, genes and DNA A gene is a small segment of DNA that contains information that is used to make a single protein. Each protein is responsible for determining a particular characteristic of an organism. Coiled DNA molecules are called chromatin threads or chromosomes, which are found inside the nucleus of a cell. Within the DNA molecule, genes exist that specify a certain, single characteristic For example, there is a gene for height, a gene for weight, and a gene for eye colour, etc.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Variations of the gene relating to the same trait are called alleles. Individuals carry two genes for each trait, one from the mother's egg and one from the father's sperm. When an individual reproduces, the two genes split up and end up in separate reproductive cells. One of these two genes is dominant over the other. The dominant allele will mask the other, called the recessive allele. For example, if the father gives a tall allele of the height gene, and the other gives a short allele, the offspring will be tall. This is because tall is dominant and short is recessive.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Human beings have cells with 46 chromosomes - 2 sex chromosomes (XX or XY) and 22 pairs of non-sex chromosomes. In the process of reproductive cell division, by which ova and sperms are produced, the chromosomes are divided so that each mature reproductive cell contains half (23) of the original number of chromosomes, or one chromosome of each pair. Thus, when the ovum and the sperm fuse on fertilisation, the fertilised egg receives one set of chromosomes from each parent and the original number of chromosomes (46) is restored.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The characteristics that an organism inherits from its parents are called traits:</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Traits are genetically determined. In humans, traits include things such as the colour of a person's hair, skin and eyes, the blood group, the shape of nose and lips, and the tendency to be short-sighted or to become bald. Certain human traits can be modified by the influence of the environment, while others cannot:</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Blood type is an inherited trait that will not change, whereas the tendency to be tall or short con be modified by what you eat, how fast you grow, illnesses and other factors</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Sometimes, it is possible to show a trait which neither of the parents exhibits This means that these genes are passed on from someone else in your family. It could be your grandparents for example, who have that trait.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Sometimes such traits can even come from great-grandparents. This is because of recessive genes. Recessive genes are genes whose trait is not displayed or expressed. The dominant gene is the gene whose trait is displayed or expressed over the unexpressed or recessive gene.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Water</key> <dict><key>States of water</key> <dict><key>The states of water are solid, liquid and gas. Water exists in the liquid state at room temperature. If we cool it down, it changes into ice. If we heat it, it changes into steam.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>When heat is applied to ice, its change in state typically goes from solid to liquid to gas. When water vapour is cooled, its change in state typically goes from gas to liquid to solid</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Heat gain</key> <dict><key>When water reaches the temperature at which a change in state occurs, the temperature will remain the same until all the energy is used to change its state</key> <dict></dict>
<key>When ice is heated, its temperature rises until it reaches its melting point (0\u00b0C).Then the ice will stay at that temperature until all the ice has melted. Heat energy is used to melt the ice and not to raise the temperature. After the ice has melted, the temperature of the water will continue to rise as more heat is applied. Thus, any additional heat added to the ice will not raise the temperature until all of the ice has melted. The additional energy merely supplies enough energy to cause the ice to melt.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>When water is heated, its temperature rises until it reaches its boiling point (100\u00b0C). The temperature will then remain at that point until all of the liquid is boiled away into steam. The temperature of the steam can then be increased.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>Heat loss</key> <dict><key>Likewise, when water vapour is cooled, its temperature will drop until it reaches the condensation point. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Any additional cooling or heat loss will not lower the temperature until all of the gas has condensed into liquid. The temperature of water will continue to drop as more cooling is applied. Once water reaches the freezing point (0\u00b0C), the temperature will remain at that point until all of the liquid has solidified and the temperature of ice can then continue to decrease.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Evaporation is a process where liquid changes into gas. Unlike boiling which occurs at a fixed boiling point of the substance, evaporation takes place at any temperature. This occurs when the atoms or molecules in a sufficient energy to enter the gaseous state. This process is the opposite of condensation. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>However, evaporation proceeds more quickly at a higher temperature. Since only a small proportion of the molecules are located near the surface and are moving in the proper direction to escape at any given instant, the rate of evaporation is limited. Also, as the faster-moving molecules escape, the remaining molecules have lower average kinetic energy, and the temperature of the liquid thus decreases. This phenomenon is called evaporative cooling.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The rate of evaporation is dependent on the following factors:</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Water cycle</key> <dict><key>It is a natural cycle. The water cycle is also called the hydrologic cycle. It is the continuous movement of water from the Earth's surface into the air and back to the Earth's surface again. Water undergoes several changes in state through different processes in the water cycle.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Water can be found in all three states during the water cycle:</key> <dict></dict>
<key>solid (ice, snow, ice caps)</key> <dict></dict>
<key>liquid (lakes, rivers, seas, oceans)</key> <dict></dict>
<key>gas (water vapour)</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The heat from the Sun is the driving force for the water cycle.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The water cycle ensures the continuous movement of water around the Earth. It ensures that the amount of water on the Earth remains the same over the years.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Usage</key> <dict><key>Water is essential to all living things. Plants derive some of their nutrients from minerals in the soil. These minerals have to be dissolved in water in order to be absorbed by the plants. Water is taken into the human body by consuming plants, meat and beverages.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Humans can go for a month without eating but will die in three to five days without water because our bodies are made up of about 70 percent water. The body uses water to maintain its temperature, breathe, digest food and lubricate moving joints.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>A wide variety of animal life, in or around freshwater ecosystems, like aquatic birds, amphibians, mammals and a wide variety of fish depend on water for survival.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Some of the most important uses of water are at our homes. It is used for indoor and outdoor purposes. All the things you do at home drinking, preparing food, bathing, washing clothes and dishes, brushing your teeth, watering the yard and garden and even washing the dog make use of water.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Use of water in commercial places is important because without it, we would not have any restaurants pizza houses, coffee shops, food centres and other eateries. Along with the eateries, water is commercially supplied to motels, offices, prisons military Institutions and fish hatcheries</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The industries that produce metals, wood and paper products, chemicals, gasoline, oils and probably every manufactured product use water during some parts of the production process.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Throughout the world, irrigation (water for agriculture or growing crops) is probably the most important use of water. Almost 60 per cent of all the world's freshwater withdrawals go towards irrigation uses. Large-scale farming will not be able to provide food for the world's large population without the irrigation of crop fields by water from rivers, lakes, reservoirs and wells. Without irrigation, crops could never grow.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Water is needed to raise livestock such as cows, chickens, horses and rabbits. Here, water is needed for watering, feeding, dairy operations and other forms of  needs. This includes water for raising cows, chickens, horses, rabbits, fish and other animals. Water is also used in the production of meat, poultry eggs and milk</key> <dict></dict>
<key> Production of electrical power results in one of the largest uses of water worldwide. Water for thermoelectric power is used in generating electricity with steam driven turbine generators.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Like other industries, mining corporations need water to make bare rocks give up valuable minerals. Water is used for the extraction of minerals that may be in the form of solids such as coal, iron, sand and gravel: liquids such as crude petroleum and gases such as natural gas. Water is needed to carry out activities such as quarrying, milling (crushing, screening, washing and flotation of mined materials, re-injecting extracted water for secondary oil recovery and other operations associated with mining activities.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Hydroelectric energy is produced by the force of falling water. The capacity to produce this energy is dependent on both the available flow and the height from which the water falls. As water builds up behind a high dam, it accumulates potential energy.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The gained potential energy is transformed into mechanical energy when the water rushes down the sluice and strikes the rotary blades of the turbine.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Interactions</key> <dict><key>Forces</key> <dict><key>Balanced and unbalanced forces</key> <dict><key>Forces occur in pairs and can either be balanced or unbalanced. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Unlike balanced forces, unbalanced forces always cause a change in the direction of motion. They are not equal and are unbalanced. When two unbalanced forces are exerted in opposite directions, their combined force is equal to the difference between the two forces and is exerted in the direction of the larger force.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Effects of forces</key> <dict><key>A force cannot be seen but its effects can be seen or felt. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>There are two ways we can experience the effects of a force:</key> <dict></dict>
<key>contact forces</key> <dict></dict>
<key>indirect contact forces/forces resulting from action-at-a-distance</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Contact forces are types of forces in which the two Interacting objects ore physically in contact each other. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Some examples of contact forces are: </key> <dict></dict>
<key>frictional force</key> <dict></dict>
<key>applied force</key> <dict></dict>
<key>when a stationary ball is being kicked, it starts to roll</key> <dict></dict>
<key>when a hand presses on a ball of plasticine, the shape of the plasticine is being changed</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Indirect contact forces are types of forces in which the two interacting objects are not in physical contact with each other, out are able to exert a push or a pull despite a physical separation. Some examples of indirect forces are gravitational force, magnetic force and electric force. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>Sometimes two forces act on an object. The sum of these forces is called the net force. If the net forces are balanced, there is no change in the motion of the object, as the two forces are equal in size and their direction of motion are opposite each other. If the forces are unbalanced, then the forces change the motion or speed of the object</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Drawing force diagrams</key> <dict><key>We can draw diagrams to describe a force. In doing so, we can provide some details of a force. You can show a force on a drawing by using a arrow</key> <dict></dict>
<key>We use arrows to show whether a force is a push or a  pull</key> <dict></dict>
<key>We use arrows to show the size of a force. A longer arrow indicates a bigger force while a shorter arrow indicates a smaller force</key> <dict></dict>
<key>We use arrows to show where the body is being pushed or pulled. This is described as the position of the applied force.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Weight and mass</key> <dict><key>When we talk about the weight of an object, everyone knows that we are talking about how heavy or light the object is. For example, we can make a statement \"The weight of a car is 1500 kilograms\".</key> <dict></dict>
<key>In Science, we use two important words and they are weight and mass. However, these two words do not have the same meaning.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Weight is the gravitational force pulling the body towards the centre of the Earth. We use springs to measure weight. When you weigh something on the spring scale, give the object a slight pull down and observe the increase in the reading</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Mass is the amount of matter in a body Other words for matter are materials and substances. We usually divide matter into three groups-solids liquids and gases</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Frictional Force</key> <dict><key>Friction is a force that resists any movement of one surface over another. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>We can experience friction in some everyday events like rubbing our hands together, sliding heavy loads across surfaces and in car and bicycle tyres. When you rub your hands together, they get warm. As one hand slides over the other, there is friction and this creates heat.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Friction results when one surface slides over another and it is caused by the roughness of the surfaces. Even surfaces that seem smooth can look quite different under a microscope</key> <dict></dict>
<key> If you try to push or pull a heavy box across the floor, you will find it hard to get started. Friction between the bottom surface of the box and the floor makes it hard to move the box.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>However, friction causes certain effects in machines.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Friction between two surfaces wastes energy, as surfaces sliding over each other results in more energy needed to start the machine and keep it moving</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Friction causes two surfaces that are in contact with each other to get hot</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Friction causes wear and tear between surfaces that are in contact with each other for a while.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Friction can be reduced by:</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Smooth surfaces</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Lubrication such as oil to keep the surfaces apart</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Rollers or ball bearing between two sliding surfaces</key> <dict></dict>
<key>There are times when we need friction to make things work. For example, tyres on cars and bicycles must grip the road so that the car will not skid, especially when roads are wet and slippery.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Magnetic Force</key> <dict><key>Magnetism is the attractive or repulsive force that acts between magnetic materials such as iron, steel, cobalt and nickel. It is a force that acts at a distance s caused by a magnetic field. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>he magnetic field in a bar magnet has two definite poles. Scientists in the earlier periods referred to these poles as the North and South poles.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The lines of magnetic flux flow from one end of the magnetic object to the other. By convention, we call one end of a magnetic object the N or  North- seeking pole and the other, the S or South-seeking pole, as related to the Earth's north and south magnetic poles</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The magnetic flux is defined os moving from N to 5. A magnetic force is developed between two bar magnets. When the poles are alike, N-N or SS, the magnetic force that develops between them is a repelling force. When the poles are opposite; N-S or S-N, the magnetic force that develops between them is an attracting force.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Materials that are attracted by a magnet, such as iron, steel, nickel, and cobalt have the ability to become magnetised. These are called magnetic materials. These objects experience a magnetic force when placed in the presence of a magnet. This magnetic force pulls the objects to the magnet.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Elastic spring force</key> <dict><key>When an object is acted upon by a force, it can be compressed, stretched or bent. If the force is removed and the object returns to its original shape, it is said to be elastic.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>elasticity is the property of an object or material which causes it to be restored to its original shape after distortion. An object is said to be more elastic if it restores itself more precisely to its original shape after distortion.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Pollution is caused by releasing pollutants into the environment. A pollutant is any substance that makes the environment dirty or harmful to live in.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Pollution can affect the land, air and water bodies such as seas.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Pollution can be cause by litter, chemicals, CFCs, untreated human waste, smoke, haze and acid rain</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, trap heat from the Sun and makes the Earth warm. This warming effect is known as the greenhouse effect, which keeps the Earth from freezing.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide are given off as a result of deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels. </key> <dict></dict>
<key>However, too many greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will lead to the surface of our Earth becoming much warmer as more heat is trapped. This is called global warming.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>How do animals and plants exchange gases with their surroundings?</key> <dict><key>The respiratory system is responsible for the exchange of gases of living with their surroundings.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>DIfferent organisms have different parts that make up their respiratory system. The table below summarises how living things exchange with their surroundings.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Insects and arachnids have openings that lead to tubes which carry oxygen to their internal organs.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Fish take in oxygen through their gills. Water contained dissolved oxygen enters the mouth of the fish. It washes over the gills and the oxygen enters the blood in the gills.As water flows out from under the gill covers, carbon dioxide from the blood is carried away.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Birds has lungs and they take in air through their nostrils.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Mammals haves lungs and they take in air through their nostrils. Some mammals such as whales and dolphins also have lungs but they breathe through blowholes on tap of their heads.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Amphibians use lungs and skin to breathe. Some amphibians such as salamander take in oxygen through their gills. Frogs can breathe through their moist skin. When they are underwater, they sue moist skin to breathe instead of their lungs.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Plants have tiny openings, mostly found on the underside of the leaf, called stomata. THey sue there stomata for their gaseous exchange. During respiration through the day, plants take in oxygen and produces carbon dioxide. Stomata are commonly found on the underside of leaves, away from direct sunlight to prevent water from evaporating.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Human circulatory system</key> <dict><key>What are the parts of the circulatory system? (Heart)</key> <dict><key>The heart is a muscular organ situated near the middle part of our chest. It is slightly tilted to the left side of the body and is protected by the ribcage.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>It is a vital organ that pumps blood all the time, to all parts of our body.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The heart is made of special muscles called heart muscles.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>We cannot control the movements of the heart muscles, though we can control other muscles such as these in the arms and legs.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Each heartbeat is a cycle of contraction and relaxation of the heart muscles.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The average rate of heartbeat of a healthy person is about 60 to 70 times per minute.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The rate of heartbeat changes with age, health and type of activity the person is doing.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>With each heartbeat, a pressure wave passes along the blood vessels, pushing blood through them. This is known as the pulse.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>We take our pulse by pressing out fingers on our wrist or neck, and counting the number of pulses felt per minute.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The normal pulse rate of a healthy young adult is about 60 to 70 times per minute. This is measured when the person is at rest.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The faster the heart beats, the higher the pulse rate.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>When we exercise, our heart rate increases.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The body requires a greater supply of digested food and oxygen that is carried in the blood to the various parts of the body. The blood also rapidly removes the carbon dioxide produced. Hence, the heart has to pump blood faster around the body.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The digested food and oxygen is used for respiration in order to release enough energy for the activity that is taking place.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>The heart pumps oxygen-rich blood to all parts of the body, through the arteries.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Blood also carries digested food and water from the digestive system to all parts of the body.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The arteries branch into fine capillaries.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The digested food, oxygen and water pass through the thin walls of the capillaries into the cells of the body.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The cells use digested food, oxygen and water to produce energy. In the process, carbon dioxide and other waste materials are also produced.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Carbon dioxide and waste materials pass from the cells of the body into capillaries.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The capillaries merge to form veins.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The veins transport waste materials to the organs that can remove them from the body, such as kidneys.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>How do the other organ systems works together with the Circulatory System?</key> <dict><key>Body systems cannot work alone. They are interconnected with one another.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Some organs could be part of several systems.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The following points shows how the circulatory system is interconnected with the respiratory, digestive and muscular system.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Circulatory and Respiratory system: It provides oxygen for the organs. Oxygen is carried by red blood cells to all parts of the body. It also removes carbon dioxide and water that the heart cells produce.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Circulatory and Digestive system: It provides the heart and other organs in the circulatory system with nutrients so that the heart can keep beating.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Circulatory and Muscular system: The heart muscles pump blood continuously to all parts of the body. SMooth muscles located in veins and arteries push blood through them with each heartbeat.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>What are the differences between the transport systems in animals and plants?</key> <dict><key>The functions of the circulatory system in animals is to transport materials through the body of the animal but the functions of the circulatory system in animals is to transport materials throughout the body of the plant and to support the plant.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Materials transported by the circulatory system in animals is oxygen carbon dioxide, digested food and water while the materials transported by the transport system in plants is water and minerals from roots, food from leaves.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Liquid flowing in the circulatory system in animals is blood while in plants is sap.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Tubes through which liquid flows in animals is arteries, veins and capillaries while implants it is water-carrying tubes(xylem) and food-carrying tubes(phloem).</key> <dict></dict>

</dict>
<key>How does electric current flow in a circuit? (Closed circuit)</key> <dict><key>An electric current can only flow in a closed or complete circuit.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>When the components of the circuit are joined to form a complete path for electric current to flow through, the circuit is called a closed circuit</key> <dict></dict>
<key>In a closed circuit, electric current flows from the battery, through the wires to other electrical components(s) and back into the battery</key> <dict></dict>
<key>A circuit can only be complete when all the components are properly connected</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>

<key>How does electric current flow in a circuit? (Connections in a bulb)</key> <dict><key>A bulb will light up when we use wires to connect it properly to a working battery</key> <dict></dict>
<key>There are two ways to connect a bulb to a battery</key> <dict></dict>
<key>When the metal tip and the metal casing of the bulb are connected to different poles of the battery, the bulb lights up</key> <dict></dict>
<key>This is because there is a complete circuit for electric current to flow between the poles of the battery</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The bulb will now light up id either the metal the metal tip or the metal casing is not connected to the battery or the bulb blows</key> <dict></dict>

<key>How does electric current flow in a circuit? (Series and parallel circuits)</key> <dict><key>A series circuit is a circuit with only one path for electric current to flow through</key> <dict></dict>
<key>If two bulbs are connected in a series and one of the bulbs is either removed or had blown, the circuit will not work. This is because the circuit is open</key> <dict></dict>
<key>An example of a series circuit is a string of Christmas lights. If any of the bulbs is missing or has blown, electric current will not flow and none of the lights within the series will work.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>A parallel circuit has more than one path for electric current to flow through</key> <dict></dict>
<key>If two bulbs are connected in parallel, one bulb will work when the other is removed or has blown</key> <dict></dict>
<key>An example of a parallel circuit is the wiring system of a house, If one of the lights blows out, electric current can still flow to the rest of the lights and appliances</key> <dict></dict>

<key>What are electric conductors and insulators? (Electrical conductors)</key> <dict><key>Materials that allow electric current to flow through them are called conductors of electricity or electrical conductors .</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Some electrical conductors conduct electricity better than others . Materials that allow electric current to pass through them easily are called good conductors of electricity</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Most metals are good conductors of electricity. Examples are gols, silver and copper</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Silver is a better electrical conductor than copper. However, copper is usually used in current-carrying wires because copper is cheaper than silver</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Some liquids also conduct electricity. Some examples are salt solution and mercury</key> <dict></dict>

<key>What are electric conductors and insulators? (Electrical insulators)</key> <dict><key>Materials that do not allow electricity to flow through them are called non-conductors of electricity of electrical insulators</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Most non-metals are electrical insulators. Some examples are glass, air, plastic, wood, clay, cloth, paper and cotton</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Most electrical appliances are cased in insulators to prevent electrical shocks. Wires are also covered in plastic or rubber for the same purpose. Materials used for insulation purposes are called insulation.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>What are electric conductors and insulators? (Circuit tester)</key> <dict><key>A circuit tester is used to distinguish between electrical conductors and insulators</key> <dict></dict>
<key>A circuit is a simple electric circuit with a bulb. However, it is an open circuit rather than a closed one</key> <dict></dict>
<key>To test whether a material is a conductor or an insulator, we connect an object made of that material to the circuit</key> <dict></dict>
<key>When an electrical conductor is connected to the circuit, the bulb lights up. This is because the abject closes the gap by allowing electric to flow through it</key> <dict></dict>
<key>When an electrical insulator ic connected to the circuit, the bulb doesn't light up. This is because electric current cannot flow through the electrical insulator, so the circuit remains open</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>Number of batteries</key> <dict><key>When more batteries are connected in series, the bulbs in the circuit shine more brightly. This is because more batteries in series provide more power to the circuit, and more electric current flows through each bulb.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>However, when too many batteries are connected in series to a bulb, the amount of current flowing through the filament may cause the filament to overheat and melt. As a result, the bulb will blow.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>Number of bulbs</key> <dict><key>When more bulbs are added to a circuit, the individual bulbs in the circuit shine less brightly. This is because the amount of electric current flowing through each bulb is decreased.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>When one of the bulbs connected in series blows, the other bulb will also not light up, because there is a break in the circuit.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Empty Cell</key> <dict></dict>
</dict>
<key>Arrangement of Bulbs (Bulbs in parallel)</key> <dict><key>When bulbs are. arranges in parallel, there are many separate parts through which the current can flow.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>When more bulbs are added in parallel to the circuit, the individual bulbs in the circuit shine as brightly as before. This is because the electric current flowing through each bulb is still the same, no matter how many bulbs tere are in parallel</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Electrical appliances in homes are usually connected in parallel. When one electrical appliance is faulty, electrical current can still flow to other appliances. THerefore, the other appliances can still work.</key> <dict></dict>

<key>Why should we use electricity safely?</key> <dict><key>Electricity can be dangerous. Electricity can cause fire and give us electrical shocks.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Most of the appliances around us run on electricity. It is important that we know how to use electricity and electrical appliances properly</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Common causes of electrical accidents include handling appliances with wet hands, handling appliances that have damages insulation or overloading power points by plugging in too many electrical appliances at the same time</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Not connecting too many appliances to one socket, making sure wires are not exposed, not touching switches with wet hands, using breakers and fuses and not repairing electrical equipment yourself are ways to use electricity safely</key> <dict></dict>

</dict>
<key>How can we use electricity wisely?</key> <dict><key>We should conserve electricity so that natural resources such as coal, oil and natural gas can last longer.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>Electricity is usually produced using natural resources, which are materials that we get from earth. Once they are used up, they cannot be replaced quickly.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>The faster we use these natural resources, the faster they run out. WHen we waste electricity, we indirectly waste these natural resources.</key> <dict></dict>
<key>We pay for electricity. By conserving electricity, we also save money</key> <dict></dict>
<key>We can conserve electricity by turning off all electrical appliances when they are not in use. Use appliances that will turn off automatically when they are not in use or have power-saving features. Use energy-saving light bulbs. They use less electricity but are bright as filament bulbs. Sleeping with lights off or using a small lamp if there is a need to have light on. Not leaving the refrigerator door open for long periods of time. THis is because the air in the refrigerator will become warm if the door is left open. A lot of energy will have to be used to cool the refrigerator again. Using a fan instead of a air-conditioner.</key> <dict></dict>
